  Hi, whilst awaiting a re-sit of my OSCP exam I decided to start a blog of Hack The Box walkthroughs. Im going to update this as often as possible, and try to improve my reporting skills. There's plenty more information to write on this page,
I intend to make it (and my walkthroughs) more comprehensive and thorough as I go along, and become more comfortable with the process.


  Another intention is to add links and pages of relevent interest and utility to those on the same journey as me.
The `Pentest-Armoury` in the `References` dropdown is the first of such pages, containing general links to helpful sites; it might be an idea to have a `Techniques` page with quick tutorials or links to tutorials of currently relevant proceedures, like 'Active Directory' attacks, 'Kerberoasting' etc. for my own reference as much as for anyone elses.


Ive also written a simple reverse-shell generator which comes in handy. [revshell-boom](https://github.com/sh1n0bi/boom-scripts).
