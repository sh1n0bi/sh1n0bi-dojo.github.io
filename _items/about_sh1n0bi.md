Hi, whilst awaiting a re-sit of my OSCP exam I decided to start a blog of Hack The Box walkthroughs. Im going to update this as often as possible, and try to improve my reporting skills. There's plenty more information to write on this page,
I intend to make it (and my walkthroughs) more comprehensive and thorough as I go along, and become more comfortable with the process.
Another intention is to add links and pages of relevent interest and utility to those on the same journey as me.
