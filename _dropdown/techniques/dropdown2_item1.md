# OSCP - Stack Overflow Practice



![bof](/assets/img/techniques/bof/buffer-overflow-example.jpg)




While the PWK course-materials covered the subject of Buffer Overflows quite well, I felt that I needed to suppliment my learning experience with more practice.

JustinSteven's [dostackbufferoverflowgood](https://github.com/justinsteven/dostackbufferoverflowgood) is the resource that did it for me.

I followed the guide exactly, and was able to grasp the concepts and methodology with more clarity than before. It also offered a ready framework to replicate the procedure with other apps vulnerable to the technique.

Here I am going to document a 'practice run', following the guide; I'm not going to spend too much time explaining things, the linked resource covers that admirably.

For this practice I'll download the [Brainpan](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/brainpan-1,51/) box from Vulnhub. To paraphrase 'Full Metal Jacket': 

This is my walkthrough; there are many like it, but this one is mine!
