Here's a list of resources that I've found useful. In the land of Pentestopia some of these guides have become Canonical.
There are so many amazingly helpful sites!!! I'll add to them as I go along. Huge thanks go out to those listed here for providing such valuable learning and reference material.
Add them all to your Bookmarks!

<h3>NetSecFocus TJNull's OSCP HTB list</h3>
TJNull has a great [resource](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html) An absolute must for anyone working towards the OSCP qualification.
He's also compiled a list of [HTB machines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) that are OSCP-like.
There is also a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLidcsTyj9JXK-fnabFLVEvHinQ14Jy5tf) is also to be found on YouTube of relevant Ippsec walkthroughs.


<h3>Ippsec's Youtube vids(OSCP-prep)</h3>
There's no better Youtube resource to learn from than [Ippsec's vids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmBpOd__N8&list=PLB7OMUC1I72U_eLxaqkehqIvZIyW3rzhp). If you think there is...'FITE ME!!!'
