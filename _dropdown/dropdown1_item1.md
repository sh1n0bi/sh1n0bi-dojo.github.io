Here's a list of resources that I've found useful. In the land of Pentestopia some of these guides have become Canonical.
There are so many amazingly helpful sites!!! I'll add to them as I go along.

<h3>Ippsec's Youtube vids(OSCP-prep)</h3>
There's no better Youtube resource to learn from than [Ippsec's vids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmBpOd__N8&list=PLB7OMUC1I72U_eLxaqkehqIvZIyW3rzhp). If you think there is...'FITE ME!!!'

<h3>Red Teaming Experiments</h3>
A pretty comprehensive and very useful command cheat-sheet from [ired.team](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/offensive-security-cheetsheets)

<h3>Basic Linux Privilege Escalation</h3>
g0tmi1k's [guide](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) is THE go-to guide for linux privesc.

<h3>Windows Privilege Escalation Fundimentals</h3>
FuzzySecurity's whole [site](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html) is an Aladdin's Cave! 

<h3>Reverse-shell Cheat-sheet</h3>
pentestmonkey's [cheatsheets](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) are definately another invaluable resource.

scund00r's [Passing OSCP](https://scund00r.com/all/oscp/2018/02/25/passing-oscp.html) helped immensely in the PWK labs. His site in general is a goldmine!

<h3>Wordpress xmlrpc exploitation</h3>
Bilal Rizwan's [page](https://medium.com/@the.bilal.rizwan/wordpress-xmlrpc-php-common-vulnerabilites-how-to-exploit-them-d8d3c8600b32) on the subject introduced me to this possible vector.
